# Summer Project @ LaRA, 2016
Summer Internship Project at LaRA, HEIG-VD.

### Things in my ambit:
- Model of RH-Y robot in Gazebo
- ROS Node and Package for the same in Gazebo
- A world file for Lab #C38 in Gazebo
- Communication between C++ and C# chat application
- Piaget as a ROS node, and ROS as a driver provider for Piaget

### Questions:
- Why do we need a chat application at all? What is it's use in connecting different robots to Piaget?

### Todo:
- Figure out a middleware for communication between C# and Linux.

  * Have a look at [XML-RPC](http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/) as well.
  * Look at [this](http://ros-users.122217.n3.nabble.com/communicating-with-windows-td895215.html) forum discussion.
  * [Hello World from Windows](http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_windows/Tutorials/Hello%20World).
- Make differential drive controller on the RH-Y robot work, using the ROS node, i.e rhy_basic to send commands.
- Study documentation for Piaget (C++, C#)
- Get answers to above questions
